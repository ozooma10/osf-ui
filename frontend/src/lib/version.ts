// Semver-ish comparison and the "needs update" badge derivation.
//
// `targetVersion` (on a view manifest and on a settings schema) is advisory and
// is the only compatibility mechanism left after capabilities/requires were
// removed: nothing is gated on it. Everything renders best-effort — a setting of
// a type this host predates comes up read-only with its own per-row hint — so
// this drives a note and a badge, never a refusal.

/**
 * Dotted-version compare, numeric per component, missing parts are 0 — so
 * "1.2" < "1.10.0" as a human expects, not as strings.
 *
 * Load-bearing quirks:
 *  - Exactly three components are compared. A fourth ("1.0.0.5") is invisible,
 *    so it can never make one version newer than another.
 *  - `parseInt` ignores trailing junk, which is how the dev harness's
 *    "1.0.0-mock" still compares sanely against a real "1.0.0".
 *  - `parseInt(...) || 0` maps NaN and 0 to 0, so a non-numeric component
 *    ("1.x.0") reads as zero rather than poisoning the comparison.
 *  - Equal versions return false: strict "less than", not "<=".
